# [Java EE Containers](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview005.html#BNABO)

> Containers are the interface between a component and the low-level, platform-specific functionality that supports the component. Before it can be executed, a web, enterprise bean, or application client component must be assembled into a Java EE module and deployed into its container.

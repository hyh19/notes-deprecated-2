# [Distributed Multitiered Applications](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview004.html#BNAAY)

> The Java EE platform uses a distributed multitiered application model for enterprise applications. Application logic is divided into components according to function, and the application components that make up a Java EE application are installed on various machines depending on the tier in the multitiered Java EE environment to which the application component belongs.

> Client-tier components run on the client machine.
> 
> Web-tier components run on the Java EE server.
> 
> Business-tier components run on the Java EE server.
> 
> Enterprise information system (EIS)-tier software runs on the EIS server.

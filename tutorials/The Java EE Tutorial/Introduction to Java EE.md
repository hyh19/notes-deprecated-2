# [Introduction to Java EE](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview001.html#A1046550)

> The Java EE platform is developed through the Java Community Process (JCP), which is responsible for all Java technologies. Expert groups composed of interested parties have created Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to define the various Java EE technologies. The work of the Java Community under the JCP program helps to ensure Java technologyâ€™s standards of stability and cross-platform compatibility.

> The Java EE platform uses a simplified programming model. XML deployment descriptors are optional. Instead, a developer can simply enter the information as an annotation directly into a Java source file, and the Java EE server will configure the component at deployment and runtime. These annotations are generally used to embed in a program data that would otherwise be furnished in a deployment descriptor. With annotations, you put the specification information in your code next to the program element affected.

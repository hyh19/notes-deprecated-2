```ruby
puts "Mary had a little lamb."
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}."
puts "." * 10

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do?
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
```

输出结果：
```
Mary had a little lamb.
Its fleece was white as snow.

**注意：`#{}` 在双引号里会被替换成变量的值，而在单引号不会这样做，它会忽略字符串里的变量。**
```bash
>> var = 'snow'
=> "snow"
>> 'Its fleece was white as #{var}.'
=> "Its fleece was white as \#{var}."
>> "Its fleece was white as #{var}."
=> "Its fleece was white as snow."
```

> A web application is a dynamic extension of a web or application server. Web applications are of the following types:
> 
> - Presentation-oriented: A presentation-oriented web application generates interactive web pages containing various types of markup language (HTML, XHTML, XML, and so on) and dynamic content in response to requests. Development of presentation-oriented web applications is covered in Chapter 7, "JavaServer Faces Technology," through Chapter 18, "Java Servlet Technology."
> 
> - Service-oriented: A service-oriented web application implements the endpoint of a web service. Presentation-oriented applications are often clients of service-oriented web applications. Development of service-oriented web applications is covered in Chapter 31, "Building Web Services with JAX-WS," and Chapter 32, "Building RESTful Web Services with JAX-RS," in Part III, "Web Services."

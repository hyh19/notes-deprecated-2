## Java Servlet Technology

> Java Servlet technology lets you define HTTP-specific servlet classes. A servlet class extends the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by way of a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers.

## JavaServer Pages Technology

> JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology lets you put snippets of servlet code directly into a text-based document. A JSP page is a text-based document that contains two types of text:
> 
> - Static data, which can be expressed in any text-based format, such as HTML or XML
> 
> - JSP elements, which determine how the page constructs dynamic content

> For information about JSP technology, see The Java EE 5 Tutorial at http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/.

## JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library

> The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) encapsulates core functionality common to many JSP applications. Instead of mixing tags from numerous vendors in your JSP applications, you use a single, standard set of tags. This standardization allows you to deploy your applications on any JSP container that supports JSTL and makes it more likely that the implementation of the tags is optimized.

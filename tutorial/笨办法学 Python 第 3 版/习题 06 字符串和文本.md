# 习题 6 字符串和文本

```python
x = "There are %d types of people." % 10
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not)

print x
print y

print "I said: %r." % x
print "I also said: '%s'." % y

hilarious = False
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! %r"

print joke_evaluation % hilarious

w = "This is the left side of..."
e = "a string with a right side."

print w + e
```

输出结果：
```
There are 10 types of people.
Those who know binary and those who don't.
I said: 'There are 10 types of people.'.
I also said: 'Those who know binary and those who don't.'.
Isn't that joke so funny?! False
This is the left side of...a string with a right side.
```

如果你想要在字符串中通过格式化字符放入多个变量，需要将变量放到圆括号 `()` 中，而且变量之间用逗号 `,` 隔开。

`%r`用来做调试（debug）比较好，因为它会显示变量的原始数据（raw data），而`%s`和其他的符号则是用来向用户显示输出的。

Let's practice everything.
You'd need to know 'bout escapes with \ that do 
 newlines and    tabs.

    The lovely world

        where there is none.

--------------------
This should be five: 5
With a starting point of: 10000
We'd have 5000000 beans, 5000 jars, and 50 creates.
We can also do that this way:
We'd have 500000 beans, 500 jars, and 5 creates.

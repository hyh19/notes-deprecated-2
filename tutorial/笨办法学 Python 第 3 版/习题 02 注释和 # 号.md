# 习题 2 注释和 `#` 号

```python
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."
```

`#` 号在字符串内就是其本身，没有注释的作用。
```
>>> "Hi # there."
'Hi # there.'
```

### 11.2.3 基礎正規表示法練習

- **例題一、搜尋特定字串**

```bash
# -n 表示列出行号
$ grep -n 'the' regular_express.txt
8:I can't finish the test.
12:the symbol '*' is represented as start.
15:You are the best is mean you are the no. 1.
16:The world <Happy> is the same with "glad".
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
```

```bash
# -v 表示取反
$ grep -vn 'the' regular_express.txt
1:"Open Source" is a good mechanism to develop programs.
2:apple is my favorite food.
3:Football game is not use feet only.
4:this dress doesn't fit me.
5:However, this dress is about $ 3183 dollars.
6:GNU is free air not free beer.
7:Her hair is very beauty.
9:Oh! The soup taste good.
10:motorcycle is cheap than car.
11:This window is clear.
13:Oh!  My god!
14:The gd software is a library for drafting programs.
17:I like dog.
19:goooooogle yes!
20:go! go! Let's go.
21:# I am VBird
22:
```

```bash
# -i 表示忽略大小写
$ grep -in 'the' regular_express.txt 
8:I can't finish the test.
9:Oh! The soup taste good.
12:the symbol '*' is represented as start.
14:The gd software is a library for drafting programs.
15:You are the best is mean you are the no. 1.
16:The world <Happy> is the same with "glad".
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
```

- **例題二、利用中括號 `[]` 來搜尋集合字元**

```bash
# [] 内只选一个字符
$ grep -n 't[ae]st' regular_express.txt
8:I can't finish the test.
9:Oh! The soup taste good.
```

```bash
$ grep -n 'oo' regular_express.txt
1:"Open Source" is a good mechanism to develop programs.
2:apple is my favorite food.
3:Football game is not use feet only.
9:Oh! The soup taste good.
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
19:goooooogle yes!

## [] 的 ^ 表示反向选择，也就是排除括号内的所有字符。

# 排除前面有字符 g 的行
$ grep -n '[^g]oo' regular_express.txt
2:apple is my favorite food.
3:Football game is not use feet only.
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
19:goooooogle yes!

# 排除前面的小写字母
$ grep -n '[^a-z]oo' regular_express.txt
3:Football game is not use feet only.

# 另一种写法
grep -n '[^[:lower:]]oo' regular_express.txt
```

```bash
# 匹配有数字的行
$ grep -n '[0-9]' regular_express.txt
5:However, this dress is about $ 3183 dollars.
15:You are the best is mean you are the no. 1.

# 另一种写法
grep -n '[[:digit:]]' regular_express.txt
```

- **例題三、行首與行尾字元 `^` `$`**

匹配行首字符用 `^`

```bash
# 开头是 the
$ grep -n '^the' regular_express.txt
12:the symbol '*' is represented as start.
```

```bash
# 开头是小写字母
$ grep -n '^[a-z]' regular_express.txt
2:apple is my favorite food.
4:this dress doesn't fit me.
10:motorcycle is cheap than car.
12:the symbol '*' is represented as start.
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
19:goooooogle yes!
20:go! go! Let's go.

# 另一种写法
grep -n '^[[:lower:]]' regular_express.txt
```

```bash
# 排除开头是英文字母的行（注意：^ 在中括号内表示反向选择）
$ grep -n '^[^a-zA-Z]' regular_express.txt
1:"Open Source" is a good mechanism to develop programs.
21:# I am VBird
```

匹配行尾字符用 `$`

```bash
# 找出行尾是 . 的行，因为 . 在正则表达式里代表一个任意字符，所以需要转义。
$ grep -n '\.$' regular_express.txt
1:"Open Source" is a good mechanism to develop programs.
2:apple is my favorite food.
3:Football game is not use feet only.
4:this dress doesn't fit me.
10:motorcycle is cheap than car.
11:This window is clear.
12:the symbol '*' is represented as start.
15:You are the best is mean you are the no. 1.
16:The world <Happy> is the same with "glad".
17:I like dog.
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
20:go! go! Let's go.
```

`^$` 表示空行

```bash
# 找出空行
$ grep -n '^$' regular_express.txt
22:
```

```bash
# 排除空白和注释行
$ grep -v '^$' /usr/local/kafka/current/config/server.properties | grep -v '^#'

num.io.threads=8

zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000
group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms=0
delete.topic.enable=true
```

- **例題四、任意一個字元 `.` 與重複字元 `*`**

`.` 表示一个任意字符，`*` 表示重复零次以上前面的字符。

```bash
# g 和 d 之间有两个字符
$ grep -n 'g..d' regular_express.txt
1:"Open Source" is a good mechanism to develop programs.
9:Oh! The soup taste good.
16:The world <Happy> is the same with "glad".
```

```bash
# 两个以上的 o
$ grep -n 'ooo*' regular_express.txt
1:"Open Source" is a good mechanism to develop programs.
2:apple is my favorite food.
3:Football game is not use feet only.
9:Oh! The soup taste good.
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
19:goooooogle yes!
```

```bash
# 两个 g 之间有一个以上的 o
$ grep -n 'goo*g' regular_express.txt
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
19:goooooogle yes!
```

`.*` 表示零个以上任意字符

```bash
# 两个 g 之间有任意个字符
$ grep -n 'g.*g' regular_express.txt
1:"Open Source" is a good mechanism to develop programs.
14:The gd software is a library for drafting programs.
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
19:goooooogle yes!
20:go! go! Let's go.
```

- **例題五、限定連續 RE 字符範圍 `{}`**

`{}` 表示重复指定次数前面的字符

```bash
# 两个以上 o
$ grep -n 'o\{2\}' regular_express.txt
1:"Open Source" is a good mechanism to develop programs.
2:apple is my favorite food.
3:Football game is not use feet only.
9:Oh! The soup taste good.
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
19:goooooogle yes!
```

```bash
# 两个 g 之间有 2 至 5 个 o
$ grep -n 'go\{2,5\}g' regular_express.txt
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
```

```bash
# 两个 g 之间有两个以上 o
$ grep -n 'go\{2,\}g' regular_express.txt
18:google is the best tools for search keyword.
19:goooooogle yes!
```

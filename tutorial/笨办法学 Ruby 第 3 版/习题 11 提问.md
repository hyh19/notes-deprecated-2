```ruby
print "How old are you? "
age = gets.chomp
print "How tall are you? "
height = gets.chomp
print "How much do you weight? "
weight = gets.chomp

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall and #{weight} heavy."
```

输出结果：
```
How old are you? 31
How tall are you? 173cm
How much do you weight? 70kg
So, you're 31 old, 173cm tall and 70kg heavy.
```

接收到的用户输入默认为字符串，如果要进行数学计算，需要先转换为整数。
```
>> x = gets.chomp.to_i
12
=> 12
>> y = gets.chomp.to_i
13
=> 13
>> x + y
=> 25
```

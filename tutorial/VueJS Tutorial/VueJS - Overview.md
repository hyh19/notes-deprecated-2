### Virtual DOM

VueJS makes the use of virtual DOM, which is also used by other frameworks such as React, Ember, etc. The changes are not made to the DOM, instead a replica of the DOM is created which is present in the form of JavaScript data structures. Whenever any changes are to be made, they are made to the JavaScript data structures and the latter is compared with the original data structure. The final changes are then updated to the real DOM, which the user will see changing. This is good in terms of optimization, it is less expensive and the changes can be made at a faster rate.

> 组件并不是真实的 DOM 节点，而是存在于内存之中的一种数据结构，叫做虚拟 DOM （virtual DOM）。只有当它插入文档以后，才会变成真实的 DOM 。根据 React 的设计，所有的 DOM 变动，都先在虚拟 DOM 上发生，然后再将实际发生变动的部分，反映在真实 DOM上，这种算法叫做 DOM diff ，它可以极大提高网页的性能表现。
